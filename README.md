<h2> Overview </h2>
 This year, Shaker Robotics took a lot of big step towards enhancing our control systems. This is our first year of integrating motion profiling and GRIP-generated vision. This was also the first year we used a Command-Based layout for our robot code. We'll go into our use of Command-Based later (spoiler alert, we really liked it)  </br>
